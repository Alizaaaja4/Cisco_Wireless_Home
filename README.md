Pratice Simulation of Wireless Method in Cisco Packet Tracer Application

Repository Title : Simulation of Wireless Method in Cisco Packet Tracer

Description : This simulation aims to visualize the concept of using wireless connections. There are eight rooms, each equipped with two computers, two laptops, one tablet, and one smartphone. All these devices are connected to a wireless network using the WRT300N Wireless Router. The simulation is designed to demonstrate the functions and configuration of wireless connections in a home network environment

#### Devices Used
  - 1 WRT300N (Wireless Router)
  - 2 Computers (PC)
  - 2 Laptop
  - 1 Tablet
  - 1 Smartphone

### Wireless Network
Wireless network is a computer network that uses radio waves or electromagnetic waves to connect devices without cables. Wireless networks can be used for various types of communication, including voice and data. 

- Benefits of Wireless Networks:
  - Does not require complex cable setup, speeding up the process of network installation and configuration.
  - Can be easily implemented in various environments and scenarios without the physical limitations of cables.
  - Allows easy access to the network from different locations within the network coverage.
  - Enables devices to move freely, maintaining the connection while changing locations.
  - Easy to add new devices to the network without the need for additional cables.
